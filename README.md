# Uninstall OneDrive & Restore Personal Folders on Windows

If you no longer use OneDrive and want to uninstall it and revert your default folders (like Desktop, Documents, Pictures) back to personal locations, follow this simple guide.

> **Important:**  
> - Modifying the Windows Registry can have unintended consequences if done incorrectly.  
> - Always back up your registry or create a system restore point first.

## Step 1: Change Default Folder Paths

By default, some user folders might be pointed to OneDrive. Let’s update them to point to local folders:

1 Press `Win + R` to open the **Run** dialog.  
2 Type:

```bash
regedit
````

and press **Enter** to open the Registry Editor.

3 Navigate to:

```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
```

4️ In the **User Shell Folders** key, look for entries with paths that end in:

```
\OneDrive
```

5️ For each entry that includes `\OneDrive`, double-click it to edit the value, and **remove** `\OneDrive` from the path.

For example:

* Before: `C:\Users\<username>\OneDrive\Documents`
* After: `C:\Users\<username>\Documents`

6️ Click **OK** to save each change.

## Step 2: Restart Windows Explorer

2️ Find and select **Windows Explorer**.
3️ Click **Restart**.

## Step 3: Uninstall OneDrive (Optional)

If you want to completely remove OneDrive:

1️ Open **Command Prompt** as an administrator.
2️ Run the following command to uninstall OneDrive:

```bash
%SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall
```

## Additional Tips

- **Backup Your Data:** Before uninstalling or changing folder paths, back up any important files stored in OneDrive.

- **Reverting Changes:** If needed, you can re-add OneDrive by downloading it from [OneDrive’s official site](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download/).
